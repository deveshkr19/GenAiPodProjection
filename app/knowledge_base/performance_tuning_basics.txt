To reduce CPU usage in OpenShift pods:
- Optimize Java GC tuning (e.g., G1GC).
- Profile memory usage using JFR or heap dumps.
- Identify hot methods using JProfiler.
- Remove unnecessary background tasks.
- Scale horizontally rather than vertically.

To reduce memory usage:
- Use caching libraries (e.g., Redis) efficiently.
- Check for memory leaks in collections.
- Reduce thread count if unnecessary.

Response time tuning:
- Use asynchronous APIs.
- Offload slow DB operations.
- Use connection pooling.
